 specific port can be selected. To use XSP2 only locally, use

Template: xsp2/xsp1_upgrade_warning
Type: note
_Description: ASP.NET 1.0 support removed
 You appear to have some ASP.NET 1.0 sites configured in /etc/mono-server1.
 Support for the 1.0 profile has been removed from Mono 2.8 and above, and
 you are no longer able to serve ASP.NET 1.0 sites. You must reconfigure
 XSP to serve these sites using either 2.0 or 4.0 profiles, assuming your
 application is compatible. Please see mono-xsp2-admin(8) or
 mono-xsp4-admin(8) to see how to regenerate a configuration for use
 with 2.0 or 4.0 profiles.
